#WP Engine Gitignore
## A .gitignore that prevents conflicts between an application and WP Engine Scripts

The .gitignore is adapted from the WP Engine default [.gitignore](http://cdn.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/recommended-gitignore-no-wp.txt). The adaptations include the following:
* Sass caches parsed documents
* wp-content/object-cache.php
* themes/twentythirteen
* themes/twentytwelve
* themes/twentyeleven
* themes/twentyten
